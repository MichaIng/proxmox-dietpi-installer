# Proxmox DietPi Installer

A Proxmox Helper Script to install DietPi in Proxmox.

## How to use

Download the script to your Proxmox host by cloning the repo
`git clone https://github.com/dazeb/proxmox-dietpi-installer.git`

## Run the script
`./dietpi-install.sh`

The installer will ask where to import the VM disk.

## This is VERY basic, i'm sure there is better ways of doing it but this works fine. Tested and confirmed working with Proxmox 7.3
